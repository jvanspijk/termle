# termle
Worlde on the terminal. 

The word lists are embedded in the header files so that no external dependencies are needed after compiling.
I tried to keep the executable size down as much as possible, but in order to make big gains here some form of compression of the word list would be necessary which I felt was not worth the effort.

Credit to [Garrett Scholtes](https://gist.github.com/scholtes) for the used word lists.
